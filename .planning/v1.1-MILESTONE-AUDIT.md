**Audited:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** gaps_found
**Overall Progress:** 79% (19/24 requirements)

## Executive Summary

The v1.1 Scale & Web milestone is 79% complete. Phases 5-7 are fully implemented and integrated. Phase 8 (Executive Summary) has not been started, leaving 5 requirements unsatisfied.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 5 | Parallel Processing | 2/2 | Complete | PARA-01 to PARA-07 (7) |
| 6 | Web Interface | 2/2 | Complete | WEB-01 to WEB-07 (7) |
| 7 | Metadata Inference | 2/2 | Complete | META-01 to META-05 (5) |
| 8 | Executive Summary | 0/1 | Not Started | PDF-01 to PDF-05 (5) |

## Requirements Coverage

### Satisfied (19/24)

**Parallel Processing (7/7) - Phase 5**
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| PARA-01 | SATISFIED | BatchProcessor.process_batch() handles 100-500 images |
| PARA-02 | SATISFIED | ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable max_workers |
| PARA-03 | SATISFIED | RateLimiter enforces 2 req/sec default |
| PARA-04 | SATISFIED | tenacity retry with exponential backoff |
| PARA-05 | SATISFIED | ProgressCallback protocol with on_progress() |
| PARA-06 | SATISFIED | Same extract_ballot_data_with_ai() used |
| PARA-07 | SATISFIED | gc.collect() every 50 ballots |

**Web Interface (7/7) - Phase 6**
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| WEB-01 | SATISFIED | gr.File(file_count="multiple") accepts 100-500 images |
| WEB-02 | SATISFIED | Results table with vote columns |
| WEB-03 | SATISFIED | Constituency PDF download button |
| WEB-04 | SATISFIED | Batch summary PDF download button |
| WEB-05 | SATISFIED | gr.Progress() with GradioProgressCallback |
| WEB-06 | SATISFIED | Error messages in results table |
| WEB-07 | SATISFIED | Bilingual labels (Thai/English) |

**Metadata Inference (5/5) - Phase 7**
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| META-01 | SATISFIED | PathMetadataParser.extract_province_from_parent_dir() |
| META-02 | SATISFIED | CONSTITUENCY_PATTERN extracts "เขตเลือกตั้งที่ X" |
| META-03 | SATISFIED | ect_data.validate_province_name() integration |
| META-04 | SATISFIED | OCR fallback fills gaps when path parsing fails |
| META-05 | SATISFIED | unicodedata.normalize('NFC', text) |

### Unsatisfied (5/24)

**Executive Summary (0/5) - Phase 8**
| Requirement | Status | Reason |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| PDF-01 | NOT STARTED | Phase 8 not executed |
| PDF-02 | NOT STARTED | Phase 8 not executed |
| PDF-03 | NOT STARTED | Phase 8 not executed |
| PDF-04 | NOT STARTED | Phase 8 not executed |
| PDF-05 | NOT STARTED | Phase 8 not executed |

## Integration Verification

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|------------|------|-----|--------|
| ProgressCallback | Phase 5 | Phase 6 | VERIFIED |
| BatchProcessor | Phase 5 | Phase 6 | VERIFIED |
| PathMetadataParser | Phase 7 | Phase 5 | VERIFIED |
| ect_data | Foundation | Phase 7 | VERIFIED |

### E2E Flow Status

**Flow: Upload → Process → Display → Export**

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| File upload | PASS |
| Batch processing | PASS |
| Metadata pre-fill | PASS |
| Progress updates | PASS |
| Results display | PASS |
| PDF download | PASS |
| JSON/CSV export | PASS |

**Overall Flow Status:** PASS (16/16 steps verified)

## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated in v1.1 phases.

## Recommendations

1. **Execute Phase 8** - Complete Executive Summary implementation to satisfy PDF-01 through PDF-05
2. **Milestone completion** - After Phase 8, run `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.1` to archive

## Next Steps

```
/gsd:plan-phase 8
```

Then execute Phase 8 to complete the milestone.
