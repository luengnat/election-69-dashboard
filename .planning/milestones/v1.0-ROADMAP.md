# Milestone v1.0: Thai Election Ballot OCR MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-16
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

A verification platform that extracts vote counts from handwritten Thai ballot images using AI Vision OCR and validates them against official Election Commission (ECT) data to detect discrepancies in Thailand's electoral process.

## Phases

### Phase 1: OCR Accuracy & Core Extraction

**Goal:** Achieve reliable extraction of vote counts from ballot images
**Plans:** 1 plan

**Accomplishments:**
- 100% OCR accuracy on test images
- Confidence scoring for extractions
- Batch processing capability
- Thai numeral conversion (๑๒๓๔๕๖๗๘๙๐ → 1234567890)
- Test suite with ground truth validation

---

### Phase 2: ECT Integration & Matching

**Goal:** Match extracted data against official ECT reference data
**Plans:** 1 plan

**Accomplishments:**
- 3,491 candidates loaded from ECT API
- Automatic vote matching by position
- Party enrichment (name, abbreviation, color)
- Discrepancy detection with severity levels
- Markdown report generation

---

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation & Analysis

**Goal:** Provide useful output formats for analysis
**Plans:** 1 plan

**Accomplishments:**
- Aggregation engine with `AggregatedResults` dataclass
- Constituency-level results with winners
- Discrepancy aggregation and pattern detection
- Statistical analysis with outlier detection (IQR method)
- Executive summary reports with quality ratings

---

### Phase 4: PDF Export Implementation

**Goal:** Production-ready system with PDF export
**Plans:** 1 plan

**Accomplishments:**
- PDF generation engine using reportlab
- Constituency results PDF with professional formatting
- Batch summary PDF with charts (confidence distribution, province breakdown)
- CLI integration with `--pdf` flag

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Single model approach** - Use Gemma 3 12B IT with Claude Vision fallback (skipped multi-model ensemble)
2. **reportlab for PDFs** - No additional dependencies, built-in graphics
3. **IQR method for outliers** - Statistical detection of anomalous results
4. **Quality ratings** - EXCELLENT/GOOD/ACCEPTABLE/POOR scale

## Issues Resolved

- Thai numeral conversion required for real-world forms
- Party-list form extraction needed prompt refinement
- OpenRouter rate limiting handled with fallbacks

## Technical Debt

- Multi-model ensemble not implemented (single model sufficient)
- Executive Summary PDF (Phase 4.5) not implemented
- Web interface and API endpoint not implemented
